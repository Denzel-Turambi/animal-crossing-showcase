## ABSTRACT
Introducing "Animal Crossings: Fishipedia," the ultimate companion app for Animal Crossing: New Horizons fans. Dive into an extensive database of all the game's fish species, complete with details like name, price, and best fishing spots. Create personalized collections, mark caught fish, and plan your fishing expeditions. Explore the underwater world like never before and become a master angler in the virtual paradise. Happy fishing!

## LEARNING GOALS
Use the technology Iâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.
- Multiple views handled by Router
- PropTypes has been implemented in all components with props
- App is responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop sizes

## WINS/CHALLENGES 
### WINS
- Skillful application of React resulted in a dynamic and interactive user interface, facilitating seamless navigation across various views and components.
- Leveraging React Router enhanced the user experience by effectively managing routing and enabling multi-page functionality.
- The project goals were accomplished comprehensively, showcasing fishes, presenting individual fish details, and successfully executing network requests.

### CHALLENGES
- Saving fishes correctly proved to be a huge issue during this project.
